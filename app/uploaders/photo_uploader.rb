  if Rails.env.production?

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url

  process resize_to_fit: [940, 533]

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process resize_to_fill: [300, 200]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
